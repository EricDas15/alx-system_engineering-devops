At ALX, we learn by doing. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done. 
This repository contains directories each corresponding to a system engineering or DevOps project. 
These projects are part of ALX - program. 
In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of the Linux Shell, Bash commands, Bash scripting, networking, APIs, and web-stack debugging to more advanced topics.
